# link-shortener

A simple link shortener I made in some free time

To use it:

    clone the repository
    create a folder called "data"
    in it, create a file called "serverAddress.txt"
    in that file, put the addess of the server running it
    for example, 192.168.100.100:8080
    if you want to change the port you have to do so in the main.py file

    then run python3 src/main.py

features i might add:

    docker
    adding expiration times to links
    managing links from the ui (viewing a list of them all, deleting etc.)
